Brief Description: The meeting detailed the creation of javascript and ecmascript. The speaker also went over e5 to e7 and future possible changes to the language.

Questions: I had several questions such as
What is the difference between javascript and ecmascript?
Are classes in javascript like classes in java?
Does every language have a governing body?

Next steps: I learned alot about the history of javascript and some of its unique qualities. I plan to attend the next STLJS meeting along with my continued education using codeschool.com, codecademy.com and treehouse.com and a few other resources.
